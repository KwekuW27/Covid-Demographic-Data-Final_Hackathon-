# Covid-Demographic-Data-Final_Hackathon-
This repository provides data visualizations using Tableau to show over a year's worth of covid-19 data within the state of Georgia from 2020 -> 2022, in a comprehensive and understandable way. Visualizations range from bar charts to tree maps, and more.  This project explores relationships between counties, cases, death rates, and preexisting health conditions.
